# MNIST
This small project explored the famous MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The objective was to experiment with different classification techniques to see how effectively they are at predicting greyscale images. A wide variety of parameters were tested to see how they altered the classification result. 



Handwritten digits taken from MNIST dataset:

# Results

The results are displayed in the Jupyter Notebook in the form of a confusion matrix image. The true label is plotted on the y-axis and the predicted label is on the x-axis. The title contains the classifier used along with the tested parameter. As shown in the example image below:
